# Get Next Line

This is a project with a simple objective, get each line requested,
but exist a complexity, when you needed storage the result and return imediatly the value when you find break line. `\n`

## Objective

This project is about programming a function that returns a line
read from a file descriptor.

## Learned

BUFFER_SIZE
 

    Learned how to set a dynamic value to make your program work diferently.
    For example: DEBUG=true if it setted you can print more informations.


Static Variable

	Some copiler start static variables with value 0, but this made your program very low, and maybe you needed set a started value to fix it.

Structure

	This project not request structs but you can use this oportunity to store each word finded.
